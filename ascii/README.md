Reading ASCII Files
===================

This directory is for text data like tab- or comma-delimited files in
which data is stored in columns and rows. Other data formats stored in
plain text, such as JSON, YAML, or XML, should go in their own
directories.

Examples on the Web
-------------------

This blog post on [Pen and Pants](http://penandpants.com) has examples of
reading numeric text tables with
[numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.io.html),
[asciitable](http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/contrib/asciitable/), and
[ATpy](http://atpy.github.com/):

Those libraries can also be used to write tables.
