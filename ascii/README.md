This blog post on [Pen and Pants](http://penandpants.com) has examples of reading numeric text tables
with [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.io.html), 
[asciitable](http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/contrib/asciitable/), and 
[ATpy](http://atpy.github.com/): http://penandpants.com/2012/03/09/reading-text-tables-with-python/.
Those libraries can also be used to write tables.
