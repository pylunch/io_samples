IO Samples
==========

Use this repository to store examples of input/output with Python.
That might include examples of reading/writing fits, ascii, csv, Excel, VO, json, yaml, xml,
raw images, or anything else!

Organization
------------

Place examples in subdirectories named for the type of file being read or written.
If more than one file type is involved pick a sensible location based on the focus of the example.
For example, if you're adding a fits example, place it in `io_samples/fits`.

Within the subdirectory you can make a new subdirectory with your name or other useful information.
Or you can just put files directly within, for example, the `io_samples/fits` directory.
No matter where you put your files make sure they have a unique and descriptive name.

Each subdirectory should have its own `README.md` file describing the relevant file type and linking
to any important technical details or library documentation
(e.g. the [pyfits documentation](http://packages.python.org/pyfits/)).
This can also be a place to link to code snippets on other sites or in [gists](http://gist.github.com).

Content
-------

Most of the samples will probably be Python source files but if you'd like to include a snippet
and explanation in a Markdown or RST file that's fine. You can also edit the `README.md` file for
specific file types to link to snippets stored in [gists](http://gist.github.com) or on
other websites.

For the benefit of others reading your code please make sure it includes useful comments and
descriptive variable names.
